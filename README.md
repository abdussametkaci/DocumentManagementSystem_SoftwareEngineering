# Document Management System (Software Engineering)
## Requirement Specification
In this project, the requirements that should be in a document management system are
used. If we summarize the project, a user logs into the system. Then all the owned
documents are shown. Here, the user can do many things such as create documents, create
folders, deleting, renaming, and returning files (docuents and folders) from trash. In
addition, the user can create a group and add users there. Such users are called admins.
These admins determine which user will have rights/permissions on the documents. They
can add rights and then delete these rights. Users added to a group log into the group and all
the details are shown. In other words, which users are there, which documents are there
and what rights they have. These users can also add comments to a document. These
comments are sent to all users as a message. Users also save after making any changes to
the document they are working on. All versions of these records are kept in the system.
